    Here you can see a Melbourne metropolitan map combining with many scatters. Each scatter represents a real property
    in Melbourne and they are pinned on the relative position according to the address. (Due to the large data set,
    setting tooltip for each node will cause slow network and low performance of Google map service, so tooltip won't
    show up when your mouse is hovering over the node.)
    <br><br>You can also find that the scatters are divided into two groups: blue & Red.
    <h5 style="color: blue">Blue represents the price of the property is higher than the average property price of
        Melbourne.</h5>
    <h5 style="color: red">Red represents the price of the property is lower than the average property price of
        Melbourne.</h5>
    So we can clearly know that the properties those located around the CBD, South and South Eastern area are more
    expensive.
