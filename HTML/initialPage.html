    <h3>Welcome to my data visualization tour!</h3>
    Hope you can get some knowledge and hints after the journey.
    <br><br>Firstly, let's see what we've got. You can find a
    pie chart above, which indicates the proportion of the type of properties in Melbourne. Our data set contains more
    than 8,000 records and when the mouse is hovering over any slice of the pie chart, you will clearly see the relative
    information about that type of property.
    <br><br>From this pie chart we can draw the conclusion that, most of the people choose to invest in house & land.
    The reason of this may be the great appreciation space. When you are ready, please click the CONTINUE button below.
